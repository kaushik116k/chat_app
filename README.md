### Purpose of app

As in the present covid situation it is very difficult to go hospitals for some small ilness conditions
and it is very important to be aware of the covid situations. So it is so good some doctors guide us about the current 
coditions. With this app we can communicate with doctors and we can see all their posts regarding any critical conditions.

Also we can know the statistics of hospital details like number of beds available, number of covid patients and etc...
Also we can communicate with people who are in bad situations, so that we can help them for thier financial status. And we can
also know their health condition. 

### My presentation

I completed login and registration to the app successfully. You can register as a memeber or also you can login using your gmail.
All the data of the users are stored using firebase. Also i was able to create dashboard which has home, profile, users.
In profile page you can change your name, profile and cover photo also you can add your phone number. In users page you can see all the 
users of the app and you can communicate to them by clicking on the respective member mail.

### Languages and tools used

I used android studio to make the app and connected it to the firebase to store the database.
Java is the language used to make the app.
I used adobe xd to create ui designs.
